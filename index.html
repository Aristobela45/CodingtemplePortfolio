                <h1>About Aristo</h1>
                <strong><small>This is where my software engineer journey begins:</small></strong>
                <p>Started my career journey as a student of an Architect major. While still exploring my major,
                    I
                    decided to be in the healthcare industry to become a Certified Pharmacy Technician. Through
                    years of experience in the pharmacy working on hands with a lot of pharmacy computer
                    programs, I
                    fell in love with processing data and working on my tasks on the computer. I took a few
                    entry
                    courses to web development with Google Coursera as my first try into a new career path. I
                    have
                    developed
                    a
                    love and a skill I didn't know I had; That's when I decided to enter a program with coding temple
                    to
                    become a software engineer as my final career path.</p>

                <h1>Career Goals</h1>
                <strong><small>Personal goals I aspire to succeed as a software engineer</small></strong>
                <p>Coming from a career background of pharmacy technician, I had the pleasure to work with different
                    pharmacy software programs.
                    As an early college student, I also had the opportunity to learn photoshop skills and editing.
                    Through years of practice from college work
                    and working as a pharmacy technician, I realized I belong in a field where it involve computer
                    skills and creating things through web.
                    My physical touch was so used to typing and eyesight starting to recognize and be comfortable in a
                    computer work setting. I want to be involve
                    in this software engineer industry where there is no ending growth; being a part of the future in
                    technologies. As the world starting to become
                    more technical and AI/CPU is becoming more of human resources, it is my responsibility to become
                    adapt to the latest technologies. This is just
                    part of my career journey in this world and I strongly believe my future end goal is being a
                    full-time software engineer.
